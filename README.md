CookieCrumbl
CookieCrumbl is a project developed for the Hack Club Scrapyard Hackathon, aiming to provide a unique and "scrappy" web experience. The website contains the cure to cancer but must first agree with cookies, human authentication, and a mass of ads. This was our first Hackathon. We've learned a lot, and still have a lot to learn...

**What is the Purpose???**
- Attempt to find the cure to cancer before ultimately being dumped by a bunch of inevitable annoying Internet pop-ups...

Features:
- Interactive Cookie Prompts: Experience an endless loop of cookie consent dialogs, parodying the overuse of such prompts on contemporary websites.
- Humorous Captchas: Encounter playful CAPTCHA challenges that add to the satirical nature of the site.
- Engaging Content: Despite the obstacles, users are teased with the promise of groundbreaking content, reflecting on the irony of inaccessible information in the digital age.
